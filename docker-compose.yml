# =============================================================
# ONE-TIME SETUP: Authenticate Pyrogram (first deploy only)
# -------------------------------------------------------------
# 1. Start the container:
#      docker compose up -d
#
# 2. Open a shell inside it:
#      docker compose exec dashboard bash
#
# 3. Inside the container, run:
#      python3 generate_session.py
#    Enter the OTP code Telegram sends to your phone.
#    The session file is saved to /app/session/ automatically.
#
# 4. Exit the shell and restart:
#      exit
#      docker compose restart
#
# After this, the session persists in the 'session_data' volume
# and you will never need to enter a code again.
